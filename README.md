# **Devfinder** - Frontend Mentor Challenge

A sleek, interactive GitHub user search application built with React and Tailwind CSS. Easily search for GitHub users, view their profiles, repositories, followers, and more. Featuring light/dark mode, error handling, and responsive design.

## **🌟 Key Features**

- **Search Users:** Enter any GitHub username to retrieve detailed user information.
- **Default User:** Initially loads data for "octocat" when the app is first opened.
- **Error Handling:** If a user is not found, an error message will be shown.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark modes using Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop views for a seamless experience.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

- **React**: To build the user interface and manage application state.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, utility-first styling and support for dark mode.
- **GitHub API**: Fetches live data for GitHub users, including their profiles and statistics.

## **🤔 What I Learned**

- How to integrate the **GitHub API** to fetch real-time user data.
- Implementing **light and dark mode** using Tailwind CSS with a class-based approach.
- Handling **API errors** effectively and displaying error messages to the user.
- Building reusable and dynamic components in **React**.
- Creating a **responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes.

## **🎯 Purpose**
